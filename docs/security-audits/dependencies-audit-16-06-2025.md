#### Conclusion

Almost all project dependencies are widely adopted and actively maintained, including React, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS, Vite, and Zod. Only flowbite and @mobily/ts-belt are niche, community-maintained packages with lower adoption, but both were manually reviewed and scanned with no issues found. Overall, the dependency stack presents a low security risk.

### 2. Vulnerability Audit (npm audit)

Audit was run using `npm audit`. The following known issues were found and resolved:

-   **react-router-dom** (7.5.1):

    -   GHSA-cpj6-fhp6-mr6j: Pre-render data spoofing
    -   GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322: DoS via cache poisoning
    -   **Fixed by upgrading to 7.6.2**

-   **vite** (6.3.2):
    -   GHSA-859w-5945-r5v3: Path traversal bypass
    -   **Fixed by upgrading to 6.3.5**

No remaining known vulnerabilities were found.

### 3. Snyk Scan

-   Command: `npx snyk test`
-   Output:
    -   Tested 100 dependencies
    -   No vulnerable paths found

---

### 4. Socket Security Scan

Socket was used to scan for risky or suspicious package behaviors:

-   Tool: `socket scan create`
-   Output:
    -   Critical: 0
    -   High: 0
    -   Medium: 0
    -   Low: 0

No packages exhibit suspicious install scripts, dangerous APIs, or obfuscated logic.

---

### 5. Zero-Day Risk Mitigation Strategy

Zero-day vulnerabilities cannot be detected through public vulnerability databases, as they have not yet been disclosed. However, the following steps were taken to minimize exposure to such threats:

-   Used **Socket.dev** to detect high-risk behaviors.

-   All dependencies were scanned with **Socket**, **Snyk**, and **npm audit**, reducing the risk of depending on compromised packages.

-   Pre-install validation can be enforced using:
    ```bash
    npx socket install <package-name>
    ```

### 6. Proposed Replacement: `flowbite`

#### Identified Issue

Among all dependencies, `flowbite` was identified as the most security-sensitive due to the following reasons:

-   **Lower popularity**: ~100k downloads/week, significantly below industry norms.
-   **Maintenance model**: Maintained by a small, non-corporate open-source team.
-   **No formal security policy** for responding to vulnerabilities.
-   **No known issues**, but as a UI component library, it interacts with DOM and user input â€” areas sensitive to client-side injection risks.

#### Security Evaluation Performed

To evaluate the security profile of `flowbite`, the following steps were taken:

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**:

    - `npm audit`: No known vulnerabilities detected.
    - `snyk test`: No vulnerable paths found.
    - `socket scan`: 0 critical/high/medium/low risks detected.

2. **Project Health Review**:
    - Maintainer activity: Low-to-medium (infrequent commits, low response time on issues).
    - Release frequency: Irregular.

#### Suggested Alternative

**Proposed replacement**: `Headless UI` + `Tailwind CSS` (by Tailwind Labs)

-   **Benefits**:

    -   Maintained by the same team as `tailwindcss` (already used in the project)
    -   Fully compatible with Tailwind CSS
    -   Widely adopted and enterprise-trusted

-   **Popularity**: 4.2M+ downloads/week
-   **Maintenance**: Actively developed and backed by Tailwind Labs
-   **Security Track Record**: No known vulnerabilities, formally audited components

---

#### Conclusion

While `flowbite` currently poses no direct threat, its small-community-maintained status and relatively low visibility make it a potential weak link. Migrating to `Headless UI` offers a stronger security posture, better long-term support, and closer alignment with the existing Tailwind ecosystem.

### 7. Final Summary:

Known vulnerabilities in key dependencies were addressed by updating vite and react-router-dom to patched versions. All remaining packages were scanned using npm audit, Snyk, and Socket, with no issues found. While most dependencies are secure and well-maintained, flowbite was flagged as a potential risk due to its limited support, and a more robust alternative has been suggested.
